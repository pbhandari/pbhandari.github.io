title: About Me
---
Hi! I am Prajjwal Bhandari. A reader, coder and coffee fanatic currently
living in Canada. I am in the process of completing my Bachelor's Degree in 
Computer Science, at the University of Toronto, Scarborough Campus, where I am
specializing in Software Engineering.

I am also a massive Linux Enthusiast and have been using it as my sole
operating system for years. Unfortunately the downside to this is that I have
amassed a tonne of config files---most for applications I haven't used in
ages---that I can't live without.

However, as valuable as my configs are, the one thing I value more is my coffee.
As far as I'm concerned, if I have a cup of hot steaming coffee in my hand,
everything is all right with the world.
